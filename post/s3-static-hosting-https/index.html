I've always been an S3 kind of guy (many of my current projects, including <a href="https://maruos.com">Maru</a>, use S3), so this guide will focus on options to get S3 set up with HTTPS.</p><h3>Background: Why Go Static?</h3><p>Static websites offer a number of key advantages over traditional dynamic websites:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are <em>more secure</em> (there are fewer moving parts on the server-side)</li>
  <li>They are <em>fast</em> because pages are pre-rendered (think compiled vs. interpreted languages) and they scale well (stateless systems like static files scale horizontally with no effort)</li>
  <li>They are <em>cheap</em> to host (no application servers, databases, etc.)</li>
  <li>They are <em>simple</em> (just deploy static files)</li>
</ul><p>Of course, the downside is that not all apps are suitable for a purely static approach. But I would argue that even when you have a truly dynamic app, you can neatly separate the dynamic modules into backend APIs that can be called by client-site scripts shipped with your static frontend—so you still have a static part of your system that can benefit from the advantages above.</p><h3>Basics</h3><p>One more thing: before we start, so we're on the same page, let's break down the pieces we need to get a static website over HTTPS up and running:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A <em>domain name registrar</em> for managing your custom domain</li>
  <li>A <em>host</em> for your content</li>
  <li>A <em>certificate authority</em> (CA) to issue your SSL/TLS certificate for HTTPS</li>
  <li>(optional) A <em>content delivery network</em> (CDN) to cache your content</li>
</ol><p>We will focus on the <em>host</em> and <em>CDN</em> for this guide because—as you will see shortly—S3 is closely tied with Amazon CloudFront, AWS's CDN offering.</p><h3>S3</h3>
<pre><code>.--------------.   
| viewer       |   
&#39;--------------&#39;   
             | HTTP
        .----|-.   
        | S3 x |   
        &#39;------&#39;   
</code></pre><p>You can't go wrong with the tried-and-true S3 bucket.</p><p>It's as simple as uploading your website content to an S3 bucket, marking your objects world-readable, and enabling static website hosting. S3 will act like your web server and serve your bucket content in response to HTTP requests.</p><p>The static bucket endpoints are a great option for quick prototypes, and you can easily use a custom domain by creating a CNAME record in your DNS setup that points to your static bucket endpoint.</p><p>One big problem though: a pure S3 approach does not support HTTPS; for that, we need to throw in Amazon CloudFront.</p><h3>S3 + CloudFront</h3>
<pre><code>.--------------.    
| viewer       |    
&#39;--------------&#39;    
             | HTTPS
.------------|-.    
| CloudFront | |    
&#39;--------------&#39;    
             | HTTPS
        .----|-.    
        | S3 x |    
        &#39;------&#39;    
</code></pre><p>You can use Amazon's CloudFront CDN in front of your S3 bucket to enable HTTPS. You will need to upload a SSL/TLS certificate from your CA of choice [1]. This is the way to go for hosting a static website out of S3 securely.</p><p>As mentioned previously, S3 does not support HTTPS when configured as a simple static bucket endpoint, so you'll need to turn off static website hosting to enforce HTTPS to your origin S3 bucket.</p><p>There are some nuances to be aware of when you take this approach. Since CloudFront sits in between the viewer and your S3 bucket, there are two SSL/TLS negotiations that have to happen with this stack:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The viewer requests content from CloudFront over HTTPS.</li>
  <li>If CloudFront has the content in it's cache, CloudFront immediately satisfies the HTTPS request using the SSL/TLS certificate you uploaded.</li>
  <li>If CloudFront does not have the content in it's cache, CloudFront requests the content from your origin S3 bucket over HTTPS <em>using Amazon S3's own SSL/TLS certificate</em>, adds the content to the CloudFront cache, and returns the content to the viewer.</li>
</ol><h3>S3 + Cloudflare (or some other CDN)</h3>
<pre><code>.--------------.    
| viewer       |    
&#39;--------------&#39;    
             | HTTPS
.------------|-.    
| Cloudflare | |    
&#39;--------------&#39;    
             |  HTTP
        .----|-.    
        | S3 x |    
        &#39;------&#39;    
</code></pre><p>You could decide that you want to use an alternative CDN to CloudFront in front of S3.</p><p>For instance, I've been seeing a lot of recommendations in the hackersphere for using the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> CDN in front of S3—probably because Cloudflare offers a generous free tier with unlimited domains, and features a one-click shared SSL/TLS certificate that works with S3 buckets configured for static hosting called "Flexible SSL".</p><p>The problem is, "Flexible SSL" isn't really secure—connections from Cloudflare to your S3 bucket are over normal HTTP. This can be misleading since a viewer may think your site is secure, when it really isn't [2].</p><p>Remember, S3 in static web hosting mode does not support HTTPS, so whichever CDN you use, you will be limited to HTTP requests back to your S3 origin...unless you stack on CloudFront.</p><h3>S3 + CloudFront + Cloudflare (or some other CDN)</h3>
<pre><code>.--------------.    
| viewer       |    
&#39;--------------&#39;    
             | HTTPS
.------------|-.    
| Cloudflare | |    
&#39;--------------&#39;    
             | HTTPS
.------------|-.    
| CloudFront | |    
&#39;--------------&#39;    
             | HTTPS
        .----|-.    
        | S3 x |    
        &#39;------&#39;    
</code></pre><p>All is not lost if you really want to use Cloudflare—or any other CDN for that matter—with S3 securely; just use the S3 + CloudFront stack.</p><p>Cloudflare, for example, does offer a "Full SSL (Strict)" option that really is secure that you should be able to get working with the S3 + CloudFront stack [3]. Note that you will have back-to-back CDNs, which seems somewhat silly for most sites.</p><h3>Beyond S3</h3><p>Although I focused on S3, the hosting landscape has evolved significantly in the past few years and there's quite a few more options to choose from now. Here are some alternatives that are worth considering [4]:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website">Azure Storage</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website">Google Cloud Storage</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/">Firebase Hosting</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/">GitLab Pages</a></li>
</ul><p>The list of providers continues to grow as serverless stacks become more popular. It looks like static web hosting will soon become—if it isn't already—a commodity.</p><p><br /></p><h3>Footnotes</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Since you're already using AWS, you can easily use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html">AWS Certificate Manager</a> to issue a free certificate.</li>
  <li>I wonder how many "HTTPS" websites out in the wild are using this setup because it's easy to get working?</li>
  <li>See <a href="https://medium.com/@sambecker/getting-cloudflare-cloudfront-s3-to-cooperate-over-strict-ssl-f70090ebdec">this blog post</a> for example.</li>
  <li>I actually switched my website over to GitHub Pages now because it is free and <a href="https://github.blog/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/">offers painless HTTPS for custom domains with Let's Encrypt</a>.</li>
